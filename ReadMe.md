## 🧭 About

This project is a minimal yet functional **task management API** written in Go.  
It follows a clear, modular design — separating logic into **models**, **controllers**, and a simple JSON-based data layer.

The goal is to provide a clean foundation for beginners learning Go web development and REST APIs, with room to extend it (e.g., by adding databases, authentication, or configuration via `.env`).
